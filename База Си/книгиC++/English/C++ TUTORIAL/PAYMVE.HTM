Visa number, this is the most convenient and quickest means of registration.
Include at least the following information;</p>

<p>Your card type, Mastercard or Visa .</p>

<p>The cardholders's name on the card.</p>

<p>Your card number.</p>

<p>The expiration date of your card.</p>

<p>The tutorial(s) you are registering for.</p>

<p>The amount you wish to remit.</p>

<p>If you wish to receive a hardcopy receipt via US&nbsp;Post Office mail,
include your complete postal address. If you do not include a postal address,
you will receive an email receipt indicating receipt of the payment.</p>

<p>Any other comments or suggestions will be helpful for improving the
current tutorials, and developing additional tutorials or teaching aids
in the future.</p>
