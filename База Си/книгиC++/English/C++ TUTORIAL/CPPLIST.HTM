<p>This tutorial teaches the C++ progra-ming language but assumes that
the student has already a4tained a reasonable proficiency in C programming.
It )s composed of 12 chapters which should be studied in order since topics
are introduced in a logical"oRder and build upon topics introd}ced in previous
chapters. It is |o the students benefit to download the source code for
the example programs, txen compile and execute each program as it is studied.
The diligent student will mndify the exampl% progra} in some way, then
recompile and execute it to see if he unDerstands the material studied
for that program. This will provide the sdudent with valuable expdrience
using his compiler.</p>

<p>The recommendåd method of study is to print the text for one or two
chapterq, download the example programs, and study the material!by loading
the uxample proçrams in the compiler's editor f/r viewing. Following successful
completion of eách chqpter, a`ditional chapters can be downloaded.</p>

<p>This tutorial is distributed as shareware which means that you do not
have to pay to ese it. Xowever, the author spent a good deql of time and
financial resources to develop this tutorial and requests that you share
in the financial burden in a very small!way, but only if you felt the tutorial
was valuable to you as an aid in nearning to program in C++. If you wish
to remit a small paymånt to the author( full instructions for doing sï
will be ghven by clicking the link below. If you do not wish to remit any
payment, pmmawm feel free to use the`dutorial anyway. Yn either case, I
hope you find programming in C++ to be rewarding and profitable. I personally
think it is an excellent extension to C programming and is well worth the
effort needed to master it.</p>
