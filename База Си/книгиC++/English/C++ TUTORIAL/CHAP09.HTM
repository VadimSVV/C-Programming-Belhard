<p>Multiple inheritance is the ability to inherit data and methods from
more than one base class into a derived class. Multiple inheritance and
a few of the other recent additions to the language will be discussed in
this chapter along with some of the expected future directions of the language.
</p>

<p>Several companies have C++ compilers available in the marketplace, and
others are sure to follow. Because the example programs in this tutorial
are designed to be as generic as possible, most should be compilable with
any good quality C++ compiler provided it follows the AT&amp;T definition
of version 2.1 or newer. Many of these examples will not work with earlier
definitions because the language was significantly changed with the version
2.1 update. </p>

<p>After completing this tutorial, you should have enough experience with
the language to study additional new constructs on your own as they are
implemented by the various compiler writers. We will update the entire
tutorial as soon as practical following procurement of any new compiler,
but hopefully the language will not change rapidly enough now to warrant
an update oftener than semi-annually. </p>

<p><b>MULTIPLE INHERITANCE </b></p>

<p>A major recent addition to the C++ language is the ability to inherit
methods and variables from two or more parent classes when building a new
class. This is called multiple inheritance, and is purported by many people
to be a major requirement for an object oriented programming language.
Some writers, however, have expressed doubts as to the utility of multiple
inheritance. To illustrate the validity of this, it was not easy to think
up a good example of the use of multiple inheritance as an illustration
for this chapter. In fact, the resulting example is sort of a forced example
that really does nothing useful. It does however, illustrate the mechanics
of the use of multiple inheritance with C++, and that is our primary concern
at this time. </p>

<p>The biggest problem with multiple inheritance involves the inheritance
of variables or methods with duplicated names from two or more parent classes.
Which variable or method should be chosen as the inherited variable or
method if two or more have the same name? This will be illustrated in the
next few example programs. </p>

<p><b>SIMPLE MULTIPLE INHERITANCE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>MULTINH1.CPP </b></p>

<p>An examination of the file named MULTINH1.CPP will reveal the definition
of two very simple classes in lines 4 through 29 named <b>moving_van</b>
and <b>driver</b>. </p>

<p>In order to keep the program as simple as possible, all of the member
methods are defined as <b>inline </b>functions. This puts the code for
the methods where it is easy to find and study. You will also notice that
all variables in both classes are declared to be <b>protected </b>so they
will be readily available for use in any class that inherits them. The
code for each class is kept very simple so that we can concentrate on studying
the interface to the methods rather than spending time trying to understand
complex methods. As mentioned previously, chapter 12 will illustrate the
use of non-trivial methods. </p>

<p>Beginning in line 32, we define another class named <b>driven_truck</b>
which inherits all of the data and all of the methods from both of the
previously defined classes. In the last two chapters, we studied how to
inherit a single class into another class, and to inherit two or more classes,
the same technique is used except that we use a list of inherited classes
separated by commas as illustrated in line 32. The observant student will
notice that we use the keyword <b>public </b>prior to the name of each
inherited class in order to be able to freely use the methods within the
subclass. In this case, we didn't define any new variables, but we did
introduce two new methods into the subclass in lines 35 through 42. </p>

<p>We define an object named <b>chuck_ford</b> which presumably refers
to someone named Chuck who is driving a Ford moving van. The object named
<b>chuck_ford</b> is composed of four variables, three from the <b>moving_van</b>
class, and one from the <b>driver </b>class. Any of these four variables
can be manipulated in any of the methods defined within the <b>driven_truck</b>
class in the same way as in a singly inherited situation. A few examples
are given in lines 50 through 59 of the main program and the diligent student
should be able to add additional output messages to this program if he
understands the principles involved. </p>

<p>All of the rules for <b>private </b>or protected <b>variables </b>and
<b>public </b>or <b>private </b>method inheritance as used with single
inheritance extends to multiple inheritance. </p>

<p><b>DUPLICATED METHOD NAMES </b></p>

<p>You will notice that both of the parent classes have a method named
<b>initialize()</b>, and both of these are inherited into the subclass
with no difficulty. However, if we attempt to send a message to one of
these methods, we will have a problem, because the system does not know
which we are referring to. This problem will be solved and illustrated
in the next example program. </p>

<p>Before going on to the next example program, it should be noted that
we have not declared any objects of the two parent classes in the main
program. Since the two parent classes are normal classes themselves, it
should be apparent that there is nothing magic about them and they can
be used to define and manipulate objects in the usual fashion. You may
wish to do this to review your knowledge of simple classes and objects
of those classes. </p>

<p>Be sure to compile and execute this program after you understand its
operation completely. </p>

<p><b>MORE DUPLICATE METHOD NAMES </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>MULTINH2.CPP </b></p>

<p>The second example program in this chapter named MULTINH2.CPP, illustrates
the use of classes with duplicate method names being inherited into a derived
class. </p>

<p>If you study the code, you will find that a new method has been added
to all three of the classes named <b>cost_per_full_day()</b>. This was
done intentionally to illustrate how the same method name can be used in
all three classes. The class definitions are no problem at all, the methods
are simply named and defined as shown. The problem comes when we wish to
use one of the methods since they are all the same name and they have the
same numbers and types of parameters and identical return types. This prevents
some sort of an overloading rule to disambiguate the message sent to one
or more of the methods. </p>

<p>The method used to disambiguate the method calls are illustrated in
lines 63, 67, and 71 of the main program. The solution is to prepend the
class name to the method name with the double colon as used in the method
implementation definition. This is referred to as qualifying the method
name. Qualification is not necessary in line 71 since it is the method
in the derived class and it will take precedence over the other method
names. Actually, you could qualify all method calls, but if the names are
unique, the compiler can do it for you and make your code easier to write
and read. </p>

<p>Be sure to compile and execute this program and study the results. The
observant student will notice that there is a slight discrepancy in the
results given in lines 84 through 86, since the first two values do not
add up to the third value exactly. This is due to the limited precision
of the <b>float </b>variable but should cause no real problem. </p>

<p><b>WE&nbsp;VIOLATED&nbsp;SOME&nbsp;OOP&nbsp;PRINCIPLES</b></p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of object oriented programming is that when you
inherit a base class into a derived class, you are implying that the derived
class &quot;is a&quot; kind of the base class, with emphasis on the words
&quot;is a&quot; in this statement. It would be silly to inherit the characteristics
of a polar bear into an object meant to describe a skyscraper, because
we cannot say that a &quot;skyscraper is a polar bear.&quot; However, since
a &quot;skyscraper is a building&quot;, it would make sense to inherit
the characteristics of a building into a skyscraper class and add the unique
properties of a skyscraper to the class.</p>

<p>The real problem is that multiple inheritance doesn't fit this problem
chosen as an example too well, except for the fact that the entities within
these classes are easy to visualize and therefore relatively easy to grasp
the concepts. At this point we are more interested in illustrating the
mechanics of multiple inheritance than principles of good object oriented
programming. You will have lots of time to study the proper use of all
forms of inheritance later. For the time being, we are interested in giving
you a complete tool box of C++ constructs.</p>

<p><b>DUPLICATED VARIABLE NAMES </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>MULTINH3.CPP </b></p>

<p>If you will examine the example program named MULTINH3.CPP, you will
notice that each base class has a variable with the same name. </p>

<p>According to the rules of inheritance, an object of the <b>driven_truck</b>
class will have two variables with the same name, <b>weight</b>. This would
be a problem if it weren't for the fact that C++ has defined a method of
accessing each one in a well defined way. You have probably guessed that
we will use qualification to access each variable. Lines 41 and 48 illustrate
the use of the variables. It may be obvious, but it should be explicitly
stated, that there is no reason that the derived class itself cannot have
a variable of the same name as those inherited from the parent classes.
In order to access it, no qualification would be required, but qualification
with the derived class name is permitted.</p>

<p>It should be apparent to you that once you understand single inheritance,
multiple inheritance is nothing more than an extension of the same rules.
Of course, if you inherit two methods or variables of the same name, you
must use qualification to allow the compiler to select the correct one.
</p>

<p>Constructors are called for both classes before the derived class constructor
is executed. The constructors for the base classes are called in the order
they are declared in the class header line. </p>

<p><b>PRACTICAL MULTIPLE INHERITANCE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>DATETIME.H </b></p>

<p>Examine the example program named DATETIME.H for a practical example
using multiple inheritance. You will notice that we are returning to our
familiar <b>new_date</b> and <b>time_of_day</b> classes from earlier chapters.
</p>

<p>There is a good deal to be learned from this very short header file
since it is our first example of member initialization used with multiple
inheritance. There are two constructors for this class, the first being
a very simple constructor that does nothing in itself, as is evident from
an examination of line 13. This constructor allows the default constructors
to be executed for the classes <b>new_date</b> and <b>time_of_day</b>.
In both cases the constructor that requires no parameters will be executed.
A default constructor is available for each of these classes. </p>

<p>The second constructor is more interesting since it does not simply
use the default constructor, but instead passes some of the input parameters
to the inherited class constructors. Following the colon in line 14 are
two member initializers which are used to initialize members of this class.
Since the two parent classes are inherited, they are alsg members Of t`is
class and can be initialized as shown. Each of the member initializers
is actually a call to a constructnr of the base`classes and it 3hould be
evident that there must bå a constructor in each case class widh the proper
number of )nput parameters to respond to the mesóages given. You will note
that in lhne 15, we are acôuAlly calling the default bonstruktor of the
<b>new_$ate</b> class since no parameters are given gxplicitly. If we chose,
wa could simply let the system call the default constructor auvomatically,
but this gives us an explicit comment on what is happeninc. </p>
M
<p>Following all membe2 initialization, the normal constructor code for
the derived class is executed which in this case is givej in line 17. </p>
*<p><b>ORDER OF MEMBER INITIALIZATION </b></p>

<p:The order of member initialization seems a bit strange, but it does
follow a few simple rules. You will recall from the last chapter that the
order of member initialization does not follow the order given by the initializa|ion
list, but another very strict order over which you have comxlete control.
All inh%rited classes are initialized first in the order they ard listed
in the class header. If lines`15 and 16 were reversed, class <b>ne7_date</b>
would sT)ll be initialized first because it is mentioned first in line
8. We mentioned!thap C++ respects its elderó and initializes its parents
prior to htself. That sho}ld be a useful memory aid in the u3e of member
initializers. </p>

<p>Next, all local claSs membebs, if there are any, are initialized in
the orfer in which they are declared in the class, not the order in whichthey are declared in vhe initialization list.</p>

<p>Finally, after the mmmber initializ%rs are all executed in the proper
order, the main body of the constructor is executed in the normal manner.
</p>

|p>,b>USING THE NEW CLASS </b></p>

<p>Example progr`m ------&gt; <b>USEDDTM.CPP </b></p>

<p>The example program named USE@TTM.CPP uses the <b>datetime </b>class
we just built, and like our pre~ious examples, the main program is kepT
very simple and straight forward. You will note that the default constructor
is used for the object named <b>low</b>, and the constructor with the member
inmtializers ys 5seä with the objects named <b>birthday <+b>and <b>special</b>.
</p>

p>The diligent student should have no trouble understaNding vhe remaining
code in this very simple example. You will note that the class, once we
are finished with it, is vesy easy to use because of the effort we put
into properly declaring it.</p>

<p><b>UTURE DIRECTIONS OF C++ </b></p>

<p>An ANSI committee has been formed to write an INSI standard for C++.
They first met in the Spring of 1990 and have released a prelimanary draft
of the standard. The goal for the release of the standard is 1998, but
until the new standard is v%leased, the C++ language was supposed to stay
fáirly stable. However, due to txe nature of compiler writers and their
desire to improve their offerings over their competitors, the language
has not remained static during this period. </p>

<p>Many changes have been added in recent years that affect the C++ programmer
in a big way. You can be sure that the language will evolve into a very
usable and reliable language. In the meantime, however, the language is
changing and we must follow in order to stay effective and competitive.</p>

<p>There are two areas, however, that should be discussed in a little detail
because they will add so much to the language in future years. Those two
topics are parameterized types and exception handling, both of which are
now available with good C++ compilers.</p>

<p><b>PARAMETERIZED TYPES </b></p>

<p>Many times, when developing a program, you wish to perform some operation
on more than one data type. For example you may wish to sort a list of
integers, another list of floating point numbers, and a list of alphabetic
strings. It seems silly to have to write a separate sort function for each
of the three types when all three are sorted in the same logical way. With
parameterized types, you will be able to write a single sort routine that
is capable of sorting all three of the lists. </p>

<p>This is already available in the Ada language as the generic package
or procedure. Because it is available in Ada, there is a software components
industry that provides programmers with prewritten and thoroughly debugged
software routines that work with many different types. When this is generally
available in C++, there will be a components industry for C++ and precoded,
debugged and efficient source code will be available off the shelf to perform
many of the standard operations. These operations will include such things
as sorts, queues, stacks, lists, etc. There is already a library of these
components available as a part of the ANSI-C++ standard. It is called the
Standard Template Library, usually referred to as the STL. Even though
studying this library is beyond the scope of this tutorial, it will be
very beneficial for you to study it and learn how to use it in your programs.</p>

<p>Most compiler writers have included the ability to use templates in
their newest compilers. The next three example programs will illustrate
the use of templates according to the proposed ANSI standard. Since some
compiler writers did not follow that standard initially, these programs
may not work with all compilers. Eventually, all C++ compilers will have
to follow the standard in order to remain competitive, so it would pay
you to study these examples.</p>

<p><b>THE FIRST TEMPLATE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TEMPLAT1.CPP </b></p>

<p>The example program named TEMPLAT1.CPP is the first example of the use
of a template. This program is so simple it seems silly to even bother
with it but it will illustrate the use of the parameterized type. </p>

<p>The template is given in lines 4 through 8 with the first line indicating
that it is a template with a single type to be replaced, the type ANY_TYPE.
This type can be replaced by any type which can be used in the comparison
operation in line 7. If you have defined a class, and you have overloaded
the operator &quot;&gt;&quot;, then this template can be used with objects
of your class. Thus, you do not have to write a <b>maximum </b>function
for each type or class in your program. </p>

<p>This function is included automatically for each type it is called with
in the program, and the code itself should be very easy to understand.
</p>

<p>The diligent student should realize that nearly the same effect can
be achieved through use of a macro, except that when a macro is used, the
strict type checking is not done. Because of this and because of the availability
of the inline method capability in C++, the use of macros is essentially
non-existent by experienced C++ programmers. </p>

<p><b>A CLASS TEMPLATE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TEMPLAT2.CPP</b> </p>

<p>The example program named TEMPLAT2.CPP is a little more involved since
it provides a templatu for an entire class rather than"a single function.
The template code is given in lines 6 through 16 and a little study will
show that this is an entire class definition. The diligent student will
recoonize that vhis is a very weak stack0class since there is nothing to
prevent popping tata from an empty stack, and there is .o indication of
a vull stack. Ou2 intent, however, is to illustrate the use of the parameterized
type and to do so using the simplest class possible. </p>

<p>In the$main program we create an object named <b>int_stack</b> in line
25 which will be a stack d%signed to store integers, and another object
named |b>float]stack</b> in line 26 which is designed to store <b>float
</btype values. In both cases, w' enclose the type we desire(this object
ôo work$with in &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; brackets, and the system creates tje
object by first replacing all instances of <b>ANY_TYPE</b< with the desired
type, ôhen creating the object of that type. You will note that any type
can be used that has an assignment capability since lines 13 and 14 use
the assignment operator on the parameterized type. The assignment operator
is used in line 14 because it returns an object of that type which must
be assigned to something in the calling program.</p>

<p>Even though the strings are all of differing lengths, we can even use
the stack to store a stack of strings if we only store a pointer to the
strings and not the entire string. This is illustrated in the object named
<b>string_stack</b> defined in line 27 and used later in the program. </p>

<p>This program should be fairly easy for you to follow if you spend a
bit of time studying it. You should compile and run it if you have a compiler
that will handle this new construct. </p>

<p><b>REUSING THE STACK CLASS </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TEMPLAT3.CPP </b></p>

<p>The program named TEMPLAT3.CPP uses the same class with the template
as defined in the last program but in this case, it uses the <b>date </b>class
developed earlier as the stack members. More specifically, it uses a pointer
to the <b>date </b>class as the stack member. </p>

<p>Because class assignment is legal, you could also store the actual class
in the stack rather than just the pointer to it. To do so however, would
be very inefficient since the entire class would be copied into the stack
each time it is pushed and the entire class would be copied out again when
it was popped. Use of the pointer is a little more general, so it was illustrated
here for your benefit. </p>

<p>All three of the previous programs can be compiled and executed if you
have a compiler that supports templates. Parameterized types are a part
of the C++ specification, and are included in most of the newest implementations.
</p>

<p><b>EXCEPTION HANDLING </b></p>

<p>A future version of C++ will have some form of exception handling to
allow the programmer to trap errors and prevent the system from completely
shutting down when a fatal error occurs. The Ada language allows the programmer
to trap any error that occurs, even system errors, execute some recovery
code, and continue on with the program execution in a very well defined
way. </p>

<p><b><i>(Note - Exception handling will be added to this tutorial very
soon.)</i></b></p>

<p><b>WHAT SHOULD BE YOUR NEXT STEP? </b></p>

<p>Once again, we have reached a major milestone in C++ programming. With
the ability to use inheritance, you have nearly all of the tools you need
to effectively use the object oriented programming techniques of C++ and
you would do well to stop studying again and begin programming. The only
topic left with C++ is virtual methods which are used for dynamic binding
or polymorphism. This will be covered in the next two chapters. The vast
majority of all programming can be done without dynamic binding, and in
attempting to force it into every program, you could wind up with an unreadable
mess, so you should approach it slowly.</p>
