<b>C++ Tutorial - Chapter 7 </b>
<p><b><font SIZE=+3>I</font><font SIZE=+2>NHERITANCE </font></b></p>

<p>One reason to use inheritance is that it permits you to reuse code from
a previous project, but gives you the flexibility to slightly modify it
if the old code doesn't do exactly what you need for the new project. It
doesn't make sense to start every new project from scratch since some code
will certainly be repeated in several programs and you should strive to
build on what you did previously. However, it is easy to make an error
if you try to modify the original class. You are less likely to make an
error if you leave the original alone and only add to it. Another reason
for using inheritance is if the project requires the use of several classes
which are very similar but slightly different. </p>

<p>In this chapter we will concentrate on the mechanism of inheritance
and how to build it into a program. A better illustration of why you would
use inheritance will be given in later chapters where we will discuss some
practical applications of object oriented programming. The principle of
inheritance is available with several modern programming languages and
is handled slightly differently with each. C++ allows you to inherit all
or part of the members and methods of a class, modify some, and add new
ones not available in the parent class. You have complete flexibility,
and as usual, the method used with C++ has been selected to result in the
most efficient code execution. </p>

<p><b>A SIMPLE CLASS TO START WITH </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>VEHICLE.H </b></p>

<p><img src="cpp0701.gif" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=0 height=209 width=260 align=right>Examine
the file named VEHICLE.H for a simple class which we will use to begin
our study of inheritance. There is nothing unusual about this class header,
it has been kept very simple. It consists of four simple methods which
can be used to manipulate data pertaining to our vehicle. What each method
does is not especially important at this time. We will eventually refer
to this as a base class or parent class, but for the time being, we will
simply use it like any other class to show that it is indeed identical
to the classes already studied. Note that we will explain the added keyword
<b>protected </b>shortly. Figure 7-1 is a graphical representation of the
<b>vehicle </b>class. </p>

<p>Ignore lines 4, 5, and 19 until the end of this chapter where they will
be explained in detail. This file cannot be compiled or executed because
it is only a header file. </p>

<p><b>THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR VEHICLE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>VEHICLE.CPP </b></p>

<p>Examine the file named VEHICLE.CPP and you will find that it is the
implementation of the <b>vehicle </b>class. The <b>initialize() </b>method
assigns the values input as parameters to the <b>wheels </b>and <b>weight
</b>variables. We have methods to return the number of <b>wheels </b>and
the <b>weight</b>, and finally, we have one that does a trivial calculation
to return the loading on each wheel. We will have a few examples of methods
that do some significant processing later, but at this point, we are more
interested in learning how to set up the interface to the classes, so the
implementations will be kept trivial. </p>

<p>As stated above, this is a very simple class which will be used in the
next program. Later in this tutorial we will use it as a base class. You
should compile this class at this time in preparation for the next example
program, but you cannot execute it because there is no entry point. </p>

<p><b>USING THE VEHICLE CLASS </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TRANSPRT.CPP </b></p>

<p>The file named TRANSPRT.CPP uses the <b>vehicle </b>class in exactly
the same manner as we illustrated in the last chapter. This should be an
indication to you that the <b>vehicle </b>class is truly nothing more than
a normal class as defined in C++. We will make it a little special, however,
by using it unmodified as a base class in the next few example files to
illustrate inheritance. Inheritance uses an existing class and adds functionality
to it to accomplish another, possibly more complex job. </p>

<p>You should have no problem understanding the operation of this program.
It declares four objects of the <b>vehicle </b>class, initializes them,
and prints out a few of the data values to illustrate that the <b>vehicle
</b>class can be used as a simple class because it is a simple class. We
are referring to it as a simple class as opposed to calling it a base class
or derived class as we will do shortly. </p>

<p>If you thoroughly understand this program, you should compile and execute
it, remembering to link the <b>vehicle </b>object file with this object
file. </p>

<p><b>OUR FIRST DERIVED CLASS </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>CAR.H </b></p>

<p>Examine the file named CAR.H for our first example of the use of a derived
class or child class. The <b>vehicle </b>class is inherited due to the
<b>&quot;: public vehicle&quot;</b> added to line 7. This derived class
named <b>car </b>is composed of all of the information included in the
base class <b>vehicle</b>, and all of its own additional information. Even
though we did nothing to the class named <b>vehicle</b>, we made it into
a base class because of the way we are using it here. To go a step further,
even though it will be used as a base class in an example program later
in this chapter, there is no reason it cannot continue to be used as a
simple class in the previous example program. In fact, it can be used as
a simple class and a base class in the same program. The question of whether
it is a simple class or a base class is answered by the way it is used.
</p>

<p>A discussion of terminology is needed here. When discussing object oriented
programming in general, a class that inherits another is often called a
derived class or a child class, but the most proper term as defined for
C++, is a derived class. Since these terms are very descriptive, and most
writers tend to use the terms interchangeably, we will also use these terms
in this tutorial. Likewise the proper C++ terminology for the inherited
class is to call it a base class, but parent class and super class are
sometimes used also. </p>

<p>A base class is a rather general class which can cover a wide range
of objects, whereas a derived class is somewhat more restricted but at
the same time more useful. For example if we had a base class named programming
language and a derived class named C++, then we could use the base class
to define Pascal, Ada, C++, or any other programming language, but it would
not tell us about the use of classes in C++ because it can only give a
general view of each language. On the other hand, the derived class named
C++ could define the use of classes, but it could not be used to describe
the other languages because it is too narrow. A base class tends to be
more general, and a derived class is more specific. </p>

<p>In this case, the <b>vehicle </b>base class can be used to declare objects
that represent trucks, cars, bicycles, or any number of other vehicles
you can think up. The class named <b>car </b>however can only be used to
declare an object that is of type <b>car </b>because we have limited the
kinds of data that can be intelligently used with it. The <b>car </b>class
is therefore more restrictive and specific than the <b>vehicle </b>class.
The <b>vehicle </b>class is more general than the car class. </p>

<p>If we wished to get even more specific, we could define a derived class
using <b>car </b>as the base class, name it <b>sports_car</b>, and include
such information as <b>red_line_limit</b> for the tachometer which would
be silly for the family station wagon. The <b>car </b>class would therefore
be used as a derived class and a base class at the same time, so it should
be clear that these names refer to how a class is used. </p>

<p><b>HOW DO WE DECLARE A DERIVED CLASS? </b></p>

<p>Enough generalities about classes, let's get down to the specifics.
A derived class is defined by including the header file for the base class
as is done in line 5, then the name of the base class is given following
the name of the derived class separated by a colon as is illustrated in
line 7. Ignore the keyword <b>public </b>immediately following the colon
in this line. This defines public inheritance and we will study it in detail
in the next chapter. All objects declared as being of class <b>car </b>therefore
are composed of the two variables from the class <b>vehicle </b>because
they inherit those variables, and the single variable declared in the class
<b>car </b>named <b>passenger_load</b>. </p>

<p><img src="cpp0702.gif" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=0 height=221 width=478></p>

<p>An object of this class will have three of the four methods of <b>vehicle
</b>and the two new ones declared here. The method named <b>initialize()</b>
which is part of the <b>vehicle </b>class will not be available here because
it is hidden by the local version of <b>initialize()</b> which is a part
of the <b>car </b>class. The local method will be used if the name is repeated
allowing you to customize your new class. Figure 7-2 is a graphical representation
of an object of this class. </p>

<p>Note once again that the implementation for the base class only needs
to be supplied in its compiled form. The source code for the implementation
can be hidden for economic reasons to aid software developers. Hiding the
source code also allows the practice of information hiding. The header
for the base class must be available as a text file since the class definitions
are required in order to use the class. </p>

<p><b>THE CAR CLASS IMPLEMENTATION </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>CAR.CPP </b></p>

<p>Examine the file named CAR.CPP which is the implementation file for
the <b>car </b>class. The first thing you should notice is that this file
has no indication of the fact that it is a derived class of any other file,
that can only be determined by inspecting the header file for the class.
Since we can't tell if it is a derived class or not, it is written in exactly
the same way as any other class implementation file. </p>

<p>The implementations for the two new methods are written in exactly the
same way as methods are written for any other class. If you think you understand
this file, you should compile it for later use. </p>

<p><b>ANOTHER DERIVED CLASS </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TRUCK.H </b></p>

<p>Examine the file named TRUCK.H for an example of another class that
uses the <b>vehicle </b>class and adds to it. Of course, it adds different
things to it, because it will specialize in those things that pertain to
trucks. In fact, it adds two more variables and three more methods. Once
again, ignore the keyword <b>public </b>following the colon in line 7 for
a few minutes and we will cover it in detail in the next chapter of this
tutorial. See figure 7-3 for a graphical representation of the <b>truck
</b>class.</p>

<p><img src="cpp0703.gif" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=0 height=259 width=474></p>

<p>A very important point that must be made is that the <b>car </b>class
and the <b>truck </b>class have absolutely nothing to do with each other,
they only happen to be derived classes of the same base class or parent
class as it is sometimes called. </p>

<p>Note that both the <b>car </b>and the <b>truck </b>classes have methods
named <b>passengers() </b>but this causes no problems and is perfectly
acceptable. If classes are related in some way, and they certainly are
if they are both derived classes of a common base class, you would expect
them to be doing somewhat similar things. In this situation there is a
good possibility that a method name would be repeated in both child classes.
</p>

<p><b>THE TRUCK IMPLEMENTATION </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TRUCK.CPP </b></p>

<p>Examine the file named TRUCK.CPP for the implementation of the <b>truck
</b>class. It has nothing unusual included in it. </p>

<p>You should have no problem understanding this implementation. Your assignment
at this point is to compile it in preparation for our example program that
uses all three of the classes defined in this chapter. </p>

<p><b>USING ALL THREE CLASSES </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>ALLVEHIC.CPP </b></p>

<p>Examine the program named ALLVEHIC.CPP for an example that uses all
three of the classes we have been discussing in this chapter. It uses the
parent class <b>vehicle </b>to declare objects and also uses the two child
classes to declare objects. This was done to illustrate that all three
classes can be used in a single program. </p>

<p>All three of the header files for the classes are included in lines
3 through 5 so the program can use the components of the classes. Notice
that the implementations of the three classes are not in view here and
do not need to be in view. This allows the code to be used without access
to the source code for the actual implementation of the class. However,
it should be clear that the header file definition must be available. </p>

<p>In this example program, only one object of each class is declared and
used but as many as desired could be declared and used in order to accomplish
the programming task at hand. You will notice how clean and uncluttered
the source code is for this program. The classes were developed, debugged,
and stored away previously, and the interfaces were kept very simple. There
is nothing new here so you should have no trouble understanding the operation
of this program. </p>

<p>Compiling and executing this program will take a bit of effort but the
process is not complicated. The three classes and the <b>main() </b>program
can be compiled in any order desired. All four must be compiled prior to
linking the four resulting object (or binary) files together. Finally,
you can execute the complete program. Be sure you do the required steps
to compile and execute this program because the effective use of C++ will
require you to compile many separate files and link them together. This
is because of the nature of the C++ language, but it should not be a burden
if a good &quot;make&quot; capability exists with your compiler. If you
are using an implementation of C++ that has a &quot;project&quot; capability,
it will make this a snap. </p>

<p><b>WHY THE #ifndef VEHICLE_H ? </b></p>

<p>We promised to return to the strange looking preprocessor directive
in lines 4, 5 and 19 in the VEHICLE.H file, and this is the time for it.
When we define the derived class <b>car</b>, we are required to supply
it with the full definition of the interface to the <b>vehicle </b>class
since <b>car </b>is a derived class of <b>vehicle </b>and must know all
about its parent. We do that by including the <b>vehicle </b>class into
the <b>car </b>class, and the <b>car </b>class can be compiled. The <b>vehicle
</b>class must also be included in the header file of the <b>truck </b>class
for the same reason. </p>

<p>When we get to the ALLVEHIC.CPP program, we must inform it of the details
of all three classes, so all three header files must be included as is
done in lines 3 through 5 of ALLVEHIC.CPP, but this leads to a problem.
When the preprocessor gets to the <b>car </b>class, it includes the <b>vehicle
</b>class because it is listed in the <b>car </b>class header file, but
since the <b>vehicle </b>class was already included in line 3 of ALLVEHIC.CPP,
it is included twice and we attempt to redeclare the class <b>vehicle</b>.
Of course it is the same declaration, but the system doesn't care, it simply
doesn't allow redeclaration of a class. We allow the double inclusion of
the file and at the same time prevent the double inclusion of the class
by building a bridge around it using the word VEHICLE_H. If the word is
already defined, the declaration is skipped, but if the word is not defined,
the declaration is included and VEHICLE.H is defined at that time. The
end result is the actual inclusion of the class only once, even though
the file is included more than once. You should have no trouble understanding
the logic of the includes if you spend a little time studying this program
sequence. </p>

<p>Even though ANSI-C allows multiple definitions of entities, provided
the definitions are identical, C++ does not permit this. The primary reason
is because the compiler would have great difficulty in knowing if it has
already made a constructor call for the redefined entity, if there is one.
A multiple constructor call for a single object could cause great havoc,
so C++ was defined to prevent any multiple constructor calls by making
it illegal to redefine any entity. This is not a problem in any practical
program. </p>

<p>The name VEHICLE_H was chosen as the word because it is the name of
the file, with the period replaced by the underline. If the name of the
file is used systematically in all of your class definitions, you cannot
have a name clash because the filename of every class must be unique provided
you keep all files in the same directory. It would be good for you to get
into the practice of building the optional skip around all of your class
headers. All class definition files in the remainder of this tutorial will
include this skip around to prevent multiple inclusions and to be an example
for you. You should get into the practice of adding the skip around to
all of your class headers no matter how trivial they may seem to be. </p>

<p><b>OUR FIRST PRACTICAL INHERITANCE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>NEWDATE.H </b></p>

<p>Continuing where we started in chapter 5, we will inherit the <b>date
</b>class into the file named NEWDATE.H and add a member variable and a
new method to the class. Actually, this is not a good way to add the <b>day_of_year</b>
to the <b>date </b>class since it is available in the structure returned
from the system call in the <b>date </b>class. However, we are more interested
in illustrating inheritance in a practical example than we are in developing
a perfect class, so we will live with this inefficiency. You will note
that we add one variable and one method to create our new class. </p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>NEWDATE.CPP </b></p>

<p>The program named NEWDATE.CPP contains the implementation for the added
method and should be easy for the student to understand. This class implementation
uses the array <b>days[]</b> from the <b>date </b>class implementation
since it was defined as a global variable there. The method named <b>get_time_of_day()</b>
involves very simple logic. It doesn't even adjust for leap years. Once
again, we are not really interested in writing a good <b>date </b>class,
but in learning the mechanics of inheritance.</p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TRYNDATE.CPP </b></p>

<p>Finally, the example program named TRYNDATE.CPP will use the new class
in a very simple way to illustrate that the derived class is as easy to
use as the base class and in fact the main program has no way of knowing
that it is using a derived class. </p>

<p>You should compile and link this program to gain the experience of doing
so. Remember that it will be necessary to link in the object code for the
original <b>date </b>class as well as the object code from the <b>newdate
</b>class and the <b>main()</b> program. </p>

<p><b>PROGRAMMING EXERCISES </b></p>

<ol>
<li>Add another object of the <b>vehicle </b>class to ALLVEHIC.CPP named
<b>bicycle</b>, and do some of the same operations as were done to the
<b>unicycle</b>. You will only need to recompile the <b>main() </b>program
and link all four files together to get an executable file, the three classes
will not require recompilation. </li>

<li>Add a new method to the <b>truck </b>class to return the total weight
of the truck plus its payload and add code to ALLVEHIC.CPP to read the
value out and display it on the monitor. This will require an addition
to TRUCK.H, another addition to TRUCK.CPP, and of course the changes to
the main program named ALLVEHIC.CPP. The answer is given as three files
named CH07_3A.H (TRUCK.H), CH07_3B.CPP (TRUCK.CPP) and the changed <b>main()</b>
program is found in CH07_3C.CPP in the answers for this tutorial. </li>

<li>Add a variable named <b>sex </b>of type <b>char </b>to the <b>name
</b>class you developed in chapter 5 as well as methods to set and retrieve
the value of this variable. The only legal inputs are 'M' or 'F'. These
additions should be done by inheriting the <b>name </b>class into the new
class. </li>
